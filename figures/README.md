# Figures

This folder contains the posterior plots generated for the screened fifth-force analysis.  
The figures illustrate the inferred distributions of the model parameters $(p_0,\Delta G/G_\mathrm{N}|_\mathrm{max})$ under different calibration settings of the distance ladder.

The folder structure is organized by analysis variant:

- **TRGB/** — Results from distance-ladder calibrations including TRGB distances.  
  Contains one subfolder per TRGB dataset (F19, A22, F24, L24).

- **no_TRGB/** — Results from calibrations using Cepheids only, without TRGB distances.

- **H0prior/** — Results obtained when including an external Planck $H_0$ prior.

Each subfolder includes the corresponding posterior plots.
