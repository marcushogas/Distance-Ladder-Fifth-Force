# Figures

This folder contains the posterior plots generated for the screened fifth-force analysis.  
The figures show inferred distributions of the model parameters $(p_0,\Delta G/G_\mathrm{N}|_\mathrm{max})$ under different calibration settings and models.

The folder structure is organized by analysis variant:

- **[SH0ES_plus_TRGB/](/figures/SH0ES_plus_TRGB/)** — Results from the joint distance-ladder calibration in which TRGB distances are incorporated together with the SH0ES Cepheid and SNe Ia data. The folder contains one subdirectory for each TRGB dataset (F19, A22, F24, L24).

- **[SH0ES_only/](/figures/SH0ES_only/)** — Results from distance-ladder calibrations using only the SH0ES Cepheid and SNe Ia data, without incorporating TRGB distances.

- **[H0prior/](/figures/H0prior/)** — Results obtained when including an external Planck $H_0$ prior.

Each subfolder includes the corresponding posterior plots.
