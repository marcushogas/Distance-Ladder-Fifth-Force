The file, **`Table_I.txt`**, provides the proxy-field values used in the analysis for all Cepheid and TRGB host galaxies across multiple cutoff radii $R_{\max}$.

Each entry corresponds to a galaxy and a chosen cutoff radius $R_{\max}$, with the following columns:

| Column | Description | Unit |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Field | Galaxy identifier | – |
| Phi_low, Phi_mean, Phi_high | Lower, mean, and upper bounds of log₁₀(\|Φ\|/c²) | dex |
| a_low, a_mean, a_high | Lower, mean, and upper bounds of log₁₀(\|a\|/(km s⁻²)) | dex |
| K_low, K_mean, K_high | Lower, mean, and upper bounds of log₁₀(\|K\|/cm⁻²) | dex |
| Rmax | Cutoff radius | Mpc |
